As well as in-person teaching, I have worked on a number of online courses, primarily for MOOC platforms. This has included work designing courses, producing course materials - both written and to-camera, and refinement/editing of existing courses.

My clients for E-Learning content have included OpenClassrooms - on their [Learn Programming With Python](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/6900856-learn-programming-with-python) course - and the University of Arts London, both as the co-creator of their [Create Expressive Videogames](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/create-expressive-video-games) course and in an editorial role.

My areas of expertise for E-Learning include, but definitely aren't limited to:
* Software Engineering Theory & Practice
* Programming, especially in Python and in declarative/functional styles.
* REST API & Microservice Infrastructure.
* Artificial Intelligence.
* Multi-Agent Systems and Agent-Based Modelling.
* Game development in Unity; game design & development generally.

If you have a course you need designing or building, or need advice on how to edit your course materials to adapt to online delivery, head over to my [Contact Page](Contact) and email me on my work email.
