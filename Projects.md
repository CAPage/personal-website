## Research
My research is in electronic institutions and normative reasoning - at the University of Bath. I am a developer on [InstAL](www.cs.bath.ac.uk/instal/) (the Institutional Action Language), InstAL-REST (a REST API extension to InstAL), and am working on a system for evaluating changes in norms at run-time in real multi-agent systems.

## Projects
As well as my PhD, I am involved in a number of projects.

# Bot Party
[Bot Party](http://playbotparty.com/) is a game about exploring intimacy and touch through sound and adorable bots. Bot Party was a finalist for the 2018 alt.ctrl.GDC IGF award. I am a developer, designer, and voice actor for the game.

# Code Liberation
[Code Liberation](http://codeliberation.org/) is a non-profit that works with women & non-binary people to create games and digital art. I have been involved in a number of projects with CLF, including two exhibition workshops at the V&A museum - where students were, over the course of a couple of months, taught to program games, with the final products shown at an event at the museum.
