I began teaching at the beginning of my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bath. This work involved lab and lecture based teaching, one-to-one and group work, and - occasionally - course design and material development. The courses I taught at Bath were:
* Artificial Intelligence
* Programming 1 & 2
* Intelligent Agents
* Software Engineering

Since then, I have also undertaken corporate training work. This work is largely for one client, facilitating an annual well-regarded long-form graduate course for a corporation in the S&P 100. I have delivered this course as part of a team both in person in London and online.

Education is my primary passion, and I'm available to design and deliver courses on a variety of different computer science topics on a consultancy basis for corporations and universities. 

If you have a course you need designing or delivering on a consultancy basis, see my [Contact Page](Contact) and email my work email.
