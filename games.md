**I am currently particularly interested in Games and Games-Adjacent work. If you have an interesting project, do let me know!**

For a few years now, I have been a member and volunteer for the [Code Liberation Foundation](http://codeliberation.org/), a non-profit that works to teach programming - particularly in game development - to women & non-binary people. I've been part of a number of workshops as an educator, including workshops that had students produce exhibitions for the V&A museum and the British Film Institute.

With Phoenix Perry, I was a designer & developer on [Bot Party](http://playbotparty.com/), an alt.ctrl game focused on exploring intimacy and touch through play and sound. Bot Party was a finalist for the 2018 alt.ctrl.GDC IGF award, and the bots have travelled the world over helping people hold hands and make music.

I am also working on a project through my company, a yet-to-be-announced game based on the [Circe](https://anotherfeather.itch.io/circe) engine. Circe is a Unity engine created to facilitate the creation of Bullet Hell games, through a LISP-like DSL for geometric pattern composition.

Popping out of videogames for a moment, I have also done some writing for Tabletop Roleplaying Game [Voidheart Symphony](https://ufopress.co.uk/voidheart-symphony/)

As someone who has a broad range of expertise and skills, I'm interested in a number of roles in games, including:
* Development work in Unity.
* Production & Project Management.
* Consulting on [AI](ai) strategy & design.
* [Modelling & Simulation](simulation) for game and economy balance.
* Software architecture design.

Let me know if you have a project you think you might want me to consult or collaborate on, head over to my [Contact Page](Contact) and email my work email.
