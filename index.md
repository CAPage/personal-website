Hi, I'm Charlie Ann. I work as a consultant and freelancer through my company, Another Feather Limited, in a wide range of loosely Computer Science related fields:
* Teaching
* E-Learning
* Modelling & Simulation
* Games
* AI

I'm currently working on finishing my PhD, on institutional self-governance in multi-agent systems, in the Computer Science department of the University of Bath.

I enjoy interesting new challenges, projects, and research from a huge array of fields, often blending computer science with the social sciences or philosophy.

If you're interested in working with me, or just want to see what I've been working on, look at the pages in the tabs above. To get in contact with me, see my [Contact Page](Contact).
