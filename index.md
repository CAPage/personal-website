Hi, I'm Charlie Ann. I am:
* A PhD researcher. I work in integrating electronic institutions into multi-agent systems (at scale), and run-time norm change. I'm currently based at the University of Bath.
* Likely to ramble about U.K. devolution law at the drop of a hat.
* A game developer. A game I have worked on - Bot Party - was a finalist for the alt.ctrl.GDC IGF award in 2018.
* A teaching assistant/occasional lecturer in Computer Science.
* A UCU member.

For more information about the projects I have been and am involved in, how to find me on other platforms, and a CV, see the tabs above.
