My interest in Artificial Intelligence is primarily focused on Symbolic AI. There's more details on the more simulation focused part of my work and research [here](simulation), but my interests, and skillset, goes beyond just modelling.

I have done a lot of work with Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents, particularly but not exclusively with the Jason agent platform, and with declarative programming (AnsProlog) more generally.

I've also worked on the Institutional Action Language ([InstAL](https://instsuite.github.io/)), a language for the description of artificial institutions, both in developing its compiler and in producing [an architecture](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2018/0066.pdf) to deploy it into a real system.

While my focus is primarily on symbolic AI, I also have a broad knowledge of other AI fields, including learning algorithms and techniques, having both used and [taught](teaching) them at various points.

If you're interested in consulting with me on an AI related topic, **particularly if you need help with AI in games**, please contact me on my work email from my [Contact Page](Contact).
