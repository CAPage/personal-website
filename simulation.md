I'm expecting to graduate from my PhD in Artificial Intelligence in early 2022. My thesis is about how agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) might make collective decisions about the norms/institutions that govern them. I'm especially focused on Tragedy of the Commons/Common Pool Resource problems, based largely on Eleanor Ostrom's work _Governing the Commons_.

I specialise in agent-based modelling and in agent societies governed by norms - sets of rules that influence, guide, and in some cases prohibit or enforce, certain types of behaviour. This approach has a lot of advantages over other forms of modelling, especially in the discovery of emergent phenomena.

As well as my thesis research into Common Pool Resources, I have made a number of other models - mostly for my own curiosity - including a model in development designed to simulate the economy of a game, and the different levers a game designer might be able to pull in stemming issues like inflation.

Things that might benefit from a modelling & simulation approach include:
* Norm modelling for policy, public or private.
* Modelling of game balance, especially game economies.
* Academic or corporate research.
